# freedrawios
A free hand drawing application for iOS with some utilities using cocos2d
The app uses cocos2d to draw smooth lines. Inspired from http://merowing.info/2012/04/drawing-smooth-lines-with-cocos2d-ios-inspired-by-paper/

In addition to smooth lines, the app will detect if the user is trying to draw an approximate circle and replace it with an actual circle.

There is a 'ruler' to help draw straight lines. The ruler can be rotated and moved around to draw lines at required places.

All the work is stored in CoreData when the app terminates or when you go back. You can create as many canvases as you want.

I'm planning to add export & import capabilities and real-time sharing. Suggestions are welcome.
